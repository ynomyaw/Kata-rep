Rumbles of thunder,
A flash of lightning in the night,
And on the hill stands is a madman, and shouting:
Now catch you in a bag,
And you will shine in it,
I so want, that you been is mine 
Then guy is rushes to the forest,
Then to the field, then to the creek,
Everything tends to catch
Lightning!
 
All rural people,
Went to look at,
How on the hill foolish(crazyman) runnig and chudeel (kinked).
He apparently in a quarrel with head,
Apparently, imself is enemy (own enemy),
Gorblimy to invent it - What a fool !
 
Then guy is rushes to the forest,
Then to the field, then to the creek,
Everything tends to catch
Lightning!
 
In the morning on a rural road
Slowly walked night hero
All shaggy (mope-headed) and gray (grey-haired),
And smiling ...
 
Then guy is rushes to the forest,
Then to the field, then to the creek,
Everything tends to catch
Lightning!
